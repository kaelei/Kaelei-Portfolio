         <p class="statement">Managing grocery trips can be stressful, especially when you don't know at a glance what is missing at home. If you live with others, duplicative items may crowd your refrigerator and pantry. 
            <br><br>Digital Pantry manages your at-home inventory with your in-store grocery list. As items are finished at home, they are decremented from the inventory list until zero. That item is then automatically added to your grocery list. At the store, items are automatically added to your inventory as they are checked off. Both lists can be managed manually to increase, decrease, add, and remove items. 
           <br><br> A household sync is planned to invite household members to update lists. This provides a dynamic at-a-glance view of your household with less planning and discussion.
            <br><br>This project is a work in progress. You may track its development at the below link. Thank you for supporting Digital Pantry.</p>
