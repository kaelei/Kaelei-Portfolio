         </h2>
         <p class="statement">Manhattanville College students dispose of excess dorm equipment every semester. When it costs more to ship a microwave home than its original cost, the decision is easy. Students need a way to buy, sell, and trade items that would otherwise be thrown away. A proprietary marketplace app for students would accomplish this and more. Community and sustainability are the driving force behind how the application is designed. 
            <br><br>Only Manhattanville College students may use the application. This eliminates safety concerns regarding inviting buyers to campus. Additionally, shortening the supply chain and eliminating waste that would be repurchased protects sustainability initiatives.
            <br><br>This project is a work in progress. You may track its development at the below link. Thank you for supporting SecondHand at Manhattanville College.</p>
